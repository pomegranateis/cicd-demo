# SAST Practical Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Setup ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED
- ✅ Project builds successfully 
- ✅ Tests pass (5 tests - all passing)
- ✅ Basic Snyk workflow exists in `maven.yml`
- ⚠️ **Manual Step Required**: You need to add `SNYK_TOKEN` secret in GitHub

**Current Basic Workflow**:
```yaml
security:
  needs: test
  name: SA scan using snyk
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
      uses: snyk/actions/maven@master
      env:
        SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

### Exercise 2: Enhanced Configuration ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED
- ✅ Enhanced workflow created: `.github/workflows/enhanced-security.yml`
- ✅ Features implemented:
  - Matrix strategy (dependencies, code, container scanning)
  - Scheduled scans (weekly on Monday 2 AM)
  - SARIF upload to GitHub Security
  - Path filtering for efficient execution
  - Container security scanning
  - Monitoring for production deployments
  - Automated notifications and issue creation

**Key Features**:
- 📊 Comprehensive scanning (dependencies, code, containers)
- 🔄 Scheduled security scans
- 📈 GitHub Security integration with SARIF
- 🚨 Automated alerting and issue creation
- 📦 Artifact archiving for scan results

### Exercise 3: Vulnerability Management ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED
- ✅ Added vulnerable dependency: `jackson-databind 2.9.8`
- ✅ Snyk configuration file exists: `.snyk`
- ✅ Project builds successfully with vulnerable dependency
- ✅ Created vulnerability management policy example

**Added Vulnerable Dependency**:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.8</version> <!-- Intentionally old version -->
</dependency>
```

**Dependency Analysis**:
- Version conflict detected: 2.9.8 (vulnerable) vs 2.15.2 (Spring Boot default)
- This creates realistic vulnerability scenarios for testing

## 📋 Next Steps for Manual Completion

### Required Manual Actions:

1. **Set up Snyk Account** 📝
   ```bash
   # Visit https://snyk.io and create account
   # Get API token from Account Settings → Auth Token
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets** 🔐
   ```bash
   # In your GitHub repository:
   # Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
   # Name: SNYK_TOKEN
   # Value: [Your Snyk API Token]
   ```

3. **Test Basic Workflow** 🧪
   ```bash
   # Push a commit or manually trigger:
   # Actions → Java CI with Maven → Run workflow
   ```

4. **Test Enhanced Workflow** 🚀
   ```bash
   # Push to main/master branch or manually trigger:
   # Actions → Enhanced CI/CD with Comprehensive Security → Run workflow
   ```

5. **Review Vulnerability Reports** 📊
   ```bash
   # After workflow runs, check:
   # Repository → Security tab → Code scanning
   # Look for Snyk findings on jackson-databind vulnerabilities
   ```

## 🔧 Remediation Exercise

### Fix the Vulnerable Dependency:
When ready to fix the vulnerability, update `pom.xml`:

```xml
<!-- Replace the vulnerable version -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.15.2</version> <!-- Updated secure version -->
</dependency>
```

### Update .snyk for Specific Ignores:
```yaml
ignore:
  'SNYK-JAVA-COMFASTERXMLJACKSONCORE-[ID]':
    - '*':
        reason: 'Acceptable risk - patched at application level'
        expires: '2024-12-31T23:59:59.999Z'
```

## 🎯 Exercise 4 & 5 Preview

The enhanced workflow already includes advanced features from Exercise 4 and 5:
- ✅ Matrix scanning strategy
- ✅ Scheduled scans  
- ✅ Conditional scanning based on file changes
- ✅ Notification mechanisms
- ✅ Security dashboard integration
- ✅ Monitoring and reporting

## 📊 Expected Scan Results

With the vulnerable jackson-databind 2.9.8, expect to see:
- **High/Critical** severity vulnerabilities
- **CVE identifiers** related to Jackson deserialization
- **Remediation advice** to upgrade to newer versions
- **SARIF reports** in GitHub Security tab

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Check dependency tree
mvn dependency:tree | grep jackson

# Build verification  
mvn clean compile test

# Manual Snyk scan (if CLI installed)
snyk test --maven --severity-threshold=medium

# Generate SARIF report
snyk test --maven --sarif-file-output=snyk.sarif
```

## 📚 Key Learning Outcomes

1. **SAST Integration**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
2. **Vulnerability Management**: Policy-based handling of security issues  
3. **Risk Assessment**: Understanding severity levels and remediation priorities
4. **Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of dependencies
5. **Compliance**: SARIF integration with GitHub Security features
