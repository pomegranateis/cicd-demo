## 🚀 Ready for Testing!

### Required Manual Steps:

1. **Get Snyk Token**: Sign up at https://snyk.io → Account Settings → Auth Token
2. **Add GitHub Secret**: Repository Settings → Secrets → Add `SNYK_TOKEN`
3. **Test Workflows**: Push commit or trigger manually

### What You'll See:

- 🚨 Vulnerabilities detected in commons-collections 3.2.1 (CVE-2015-6420) and commons-compress 1.18 (CVE-2019-12402)
- 📊 Security reports in GitHub Actions
- 🛡️ SARIF findings in Security tab
- 📋 Automated issue creation for critical findings

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 🚨 Issue: "authentication failed (timeout)"

**Error Details:**

```
ERROR   Unspecified Error (SNYK-CLI-0000)
         authentication failed (timeout)
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Check SNYK_TOKEN Configuration:**

   ```bash
   # In your GitHub repository:
   # Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   # Verify SNYK_TOKEN exists and has the correct value
   ```

2. **Verify Token Validity:**

   - Go to https://snyk.io
   - Login to your account
   - Navigate to Account Settings → Auth Token
   - Copy a fresh token (tokens can expire)
   - Update the GitHub secret with the new token

3. **Manual Token Testing (if you have Snyk CLI locally):**

   ```bash
   npm install -g snyk
   snyk auth [YOUR_TOKEN]
   snyk test --maven
   ```

4. **Network/Firewall Issues:**

   - GitHub Actions might have network restrictions
   - Try triggering the workflow again (transient network issue)
   - Check GitHub Actions status page

5. **Alternative: Use GitHub Dependabot** (if Snyk continues to fail):
   ```yaml
   # Create .github/dependabot.yml
   version: 2
   updates:
     - package-ecosystem: "maven"
       directory: "/"
       schedule:
         interval: "weekly"
   ```

### 🔄 If Authentication Keeps Failing:

1. **Recreate Snyk Account:**

   - Delete old account if needed
   - Sign up fresh at https://snyk.io
   - Generate new API token

2. **Check Token Format:**

   - Should look like: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - No extra spaces or characters

3. **Test with Minimal Workflow:**
   ```yaml
   name: Snyk Test
   on: workflow_dispatch
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - run: echo "Testing Snyk token..."
         - uses: snyk/actions/maven@master
           env:
             SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
   ```
